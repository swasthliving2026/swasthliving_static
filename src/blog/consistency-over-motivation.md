## Why motivation fails

Motivation is emotional.
Consistency is structural.

## The problem with motivation-based plans

- They depend on mood
- They break during stress
- They create guilt cycles

## How consistency is built

Consistency comes from:
- Simple routines
- Flexible nutrition
- Forgiving missed days

## Final takeaway

You don’t need more motivation.

You need fewer decisions.
