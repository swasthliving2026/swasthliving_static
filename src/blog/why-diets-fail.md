## Why do most diets fail?

Most diets fail not because people lack willpower, but because the system itself is broken.

Crash diets rely on:
- Extreme calorie cuts
- Food elimination
- Short-term motivation

This approach ignores how the human body and mind actually work.

## The real reasons diets don’t work

### 1. They are not sustainable  
If a plan cannot be followed for years, it won’t work for months.

### 2. They ignore lifestyle  
Indian food culture, work schedules, sleep, and stress are rarely considered.

### 3. They focus on rules, not habits  
Rules break under pressure. Habits survive real life.

## What actually works for fat loss

Sustainable fat loss is built on:
- Calorie awareness (not obsession)
- Strength training
- Protein-focused meals
- Consistency over motivation

## Final takeaway

Stop searching for the perfect diet.

Build a system you can follow even on bad days.
