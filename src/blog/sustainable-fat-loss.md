## What is sustainable fat loss?

Sustainable fat loss means losing fat while:
- Eating normal food
- Training safely
- Maintaining energy and productivity

## Why fast weight loss backfires

Rapid fat loss often leads to:
- Muscle loss
- Hormonal disruption
- Metabolic slowdown
- Weight regain

## The pillars of sustainable fat loss

### 1. Calorie awareness  
You don’t need to count forever — just long enough to understand portions.

### 2. Strength training  
Muscle protects metabolism and improves insulin sensitivity.

### 3. Recovery and sleep  
Fat loss does not happen without proper recovery.

## Final takeaway

Fat loss should feel boring, repeatable, and predictable.

That’s how you know it’s working.
