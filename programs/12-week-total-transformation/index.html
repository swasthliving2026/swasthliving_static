<!-- PROBLEM AWARENESS -->
<section class="program-section">
  <div class="container">
    <h2>If This Sounds Like You, Read On</h2>
    <p class="program-text">
      You’ve tried diets. You’ve lost weight before. And somehow, it always comes back.
      Not because you’re lazy — but because quick fixes don’t build systems.
    </p>

    <ul class="program-list">
      <li>You lose weight but regain it within months</li>
      <li>You struggle with consistency and motivation</li>
      <li>You feel confused by conflicting fitness advice</li>

<!-- WHY THIS WORKS -->
<section class="program-section dark">
  <div class="container">
    <h2>Why This Program Works</h2>
    <p class="program-text">
      This isn’t a challenge or a diet plan. It’s a structured lifestyle rebuild,
      guided by coaches who support you weekly — not judge you.
    </p>

    <div class="feature-grid">
      <div class="feature-card">
        <h3>Coaching with Compassion</h3>
        <p>
          Weekly check-ins keep you supported, motivated, and accountable —
          even during off weeks.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="feature-card">
        <h3>Flexible Indian Nutrition</h3>
        <p>
          Eat real Indian food. No extreme restrictions.
          Sustainable habits that work long-term.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="feature-card">
        <h3>Gym or Home Training</h3>
        <p>
          Gym is optional. We adapt training based on your lifestyle,
          injuries, and access.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="feature-card">
        <h3>Habit & Lifestyle Systems</h3>
        <p>
          We build routines around sleep, stress, movement, and recovery —
          not just workouts.
