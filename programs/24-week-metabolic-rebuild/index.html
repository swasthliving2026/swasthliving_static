<!-- PROBLEM AWARENESS -->
<section class="program-section">
  <div class="container">
    <h2>If Weight Loss Feels Unfair, This May Be Why</h2>
    <p class="program-text">
      You eat carefully. You try to stay active. Yet the scale barely moves —
      or moves in the wrong direction. This is often a sign of deeper
      metabolic dysfunction, not lack of effort.
    </p>

    <ul class="program-list">
      <li>You have PCOS, thyroid issues, or insulin resistance</li>
      <li>You’ve tried multiple diets with little or no success</li>
      <li>Your energy, sleep, or recovery feels poor</li>
      <li>Your weight gain feels disproportionate to your habits</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</section>

<!-- WHY THIS WORKS -->
<section class="program-section dark">
  <div class="container">
    <h2>Why the Metabolic Rebuild Works</h2>
    <p class="program-text">
      This is not a diet or a quick fix. It’s a long-term,
      coached approach to restoring metabolic health by addressing
      the root causes — not just calories.
    </p>

    <div class="feature-grid">
      <div class="feature-card">
        <h3>Coaching with Compassion</h3>
        <p>
          Weekly check-ins ensure you’re supported, understood,
          and guided — especially during slow or frustrating phases.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="feature-card">
        <h3>Insulin & Hormone-Friendly Nutrition</h3>
        <p>
          Indian meals structured to improve insulin sensitivity
          and reduce inflammation — without extremes.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="feature-card">
        <h3>Low-Stress, Adaptive Training</h3>
        <p>
          Gym or home-based movement designed to support recovery,
          not spike stress hormones.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="feature-card">
        <h3>Lifestyle & Recovery Focus</h3>
        <p>
          Sleep, stress, daily movement, and consistency
          are treated as non-negotiables for fat loss.
